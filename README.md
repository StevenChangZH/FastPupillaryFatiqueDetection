# PupilDetection
Real-time pupil detection using OpenCV &amp; C++.

## What is it?
We use it to detect the tiredness of human.

## Build and Language
How to use it: create a project in your vs, add OpenCV environment and add codes.

However, please notice:

* C++11 is used, so you might need a latest C++ compiler. The IDE I used is Visual Studio 2012. I advise you not use earlier IDE for you might have problems compiling it. Even though we know, VS do not support all C++11 features (at least, I cannot use default and delete functions).
* And OpenCV version is 2411.
* windows.h is needed. I will try to remove it to support more platforms.
